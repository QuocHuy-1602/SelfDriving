## YOLO: What is it?
* A state-of-the-art object identification technique called You Only Look Once (YOLO) dramatically expedites and streamlines the process of recognizing things in photos and videos. In contrast to conventional methods, YOLO predicts item positions and categories straight forward, treating object detection as a single step.
* It accomplishes real-time detection without compromising accuracy in this way. Because of how quickly YOLO's neural network design processes images, it is useful for robotics, self-driving automobiles, and surveillance.
YOLO's distinct methodology has transformed object detection by enhancing its speed and accessibility while preserving optimal performance.

## YOLOv8: 
* A set of neural network models is called YOLOv8. PyTorch was used to build and train these models, which were then exported as files with the.pt extension. We employ the middle-sized yolov8m.pt model for object detection in this project.
The COCO dataset, an enormous collection of images including 80 distinct categories, serves as the pre-training dataset for all YOLOv8 object detection algorithms.
* Ultralytics YOLOv8 is a cutting-edge, state-of-the-art (SOTA) model that builds upon the success of previous YOLO versions and introduces new features and improvements to further boost performance and flexibility. YOLOv8 is designed to be fast, accurate, and easy to use, making it an excellent choice for a wide range of object detection and tracking, instance segmentation, image classification and pose estimation tasks
